# TrustProof 🔐  
A machine learning–powered tool for detecting Sybil wallets based on wallet activity across Ethereum, Base, and Solana chains.

## 🚀 Objective  
The goal of TrustProof is to classify wallets as human or Sybil (fake) by analyzing blockchain activity data. This will help crypto projects prevent Sybil attacks, ensure fair airdrop distributions, and maintain the integrity of Web3 ecosystems.

## 🧠 What Is a Sybil Wallet?  
A Sybil wallet is typically created by a user pretending to be multiple people in order to manipulate rewards, airdrops, or governance votes. These wallets often follow detectable patterns of behavior.

## 🔬 How It Works  
We use labeled blockchain datasets (Sybil vs human wallets) and extract behavioral features from:

- Ethereum & Base historical transactions  
- ERC-20 token transfers  
- DEX swap data  
- (Coming Soon) Solana activity  

These features are used to train a machine learning model that outputs a Sybil probability score from 0 to 1 for any given wallet.
